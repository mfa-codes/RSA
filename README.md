# RSA

This is a smaller short code for the RSA encryption method. This code I wrote completely in Python. The file "RSA.py" contains the method for encryption as well as decryption. The file "main.py" uses the methods and starts the program. The file "RSAFile.py" reads the content in the file "testFile.txt" and encrypts it. afterwards it decrypts the again 

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is an asymmetric cryptographic method that can be used for both encryption and digital signing.
